            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Introduces the concept of queues as a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.<br>
            <strong>➥ Key Characteristics:</strong><br>
            Explains the key characteristics of queues, including their ordered nature and how elements are added to the rear (enqueue) and removed from the front (dequeue).<br>
            <strong>➥ Operations:</strong>  Covers basic queue operations such as enqueue, dequeue, peek (viewing the front element without removing it), and isEmpty (checking if the queue is empty).<br>
            <strong>➥ Implementation:</strong> Discusses different ways to implement queues, such as using arrays, linked lists, or circular arrays, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.
